Token Builder

This web app allows users to create their own custom ERC20 tokens.

Once the token is created, the user has ownership of the new token contract.

The owner of any custom ERC20 token contract can mint additional tokens.

Holders of any ERC20 token can transfer the tokens, give an allowance to another address, or burn them.

Addresses with an allowance can withdraw the tokens to their account, or send them to a third address.
